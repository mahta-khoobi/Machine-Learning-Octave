# Machine-Learning-Octave
My Machine Learning Course using Octave for ML algorithms.

different exercise are done see the details here to get to know what happen in each one:

Ex1: in ex1 file: implemented linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. Suppose you are the CEO of a
restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
3You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand
to next.
The file ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a
loss.

in ex2 multi.m file: implement linear regression with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses. Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be. One way to do this is to first collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing prices.
The file ex1data2.txt contains a training set of housing prices in Portland, Oregon. The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house. The ex1 multi.m script has been set up to help you step through this exercise.
